This addon simply restores the old behavior of clicking a quest in the quest tracker. Before 7.2, this would open your quest details. For some reason in 7.2, Blizzard broke this and now it opens your map or your quest+map, depending on which one was opened more recently. 

With this addon, it will always open your quest log.

This is done by simply restoring the old code, which I got from https://github.com/tekkub/wow-ui-source
